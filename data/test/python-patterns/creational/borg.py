*What is this pattern about?
The Borg pattern (also known as the Monostate pattern) is a way to
implement singleton behavior, but instead of having only one instance
of a class, there are multiple instances that share the same state. In
other words, the focus is on sharing state instead of sharing instance
identity.

*What does this example do?
To understand the implementation of this pattern in Python, it is
important to know that, in Python, instance attributes are stored in a
attribute dictionary called __dict__. Usually, each instance will have
its own dictionary, but the Borg pattern modifies this so that all
instances have the same dictionary.
In this example, the __shared_state attribute will be the dictionary
shared between all instances, and this is ensured by assigning
__shared_state to the __dict__ variable when initializing a new
instance (i.e., in the __init__ method). Other attributes are usually
added to the instance's attribute dictionary, but, since the attribute
dictionary itself is shared (which is __shared_state), all other
attributes will also be shared.

*Where is the pattern used practically?
Sharing state is useful in applications like managing database connections:

*TL;DR
Provides singleton-like behavior sharing state between instances.
